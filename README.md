#  Pitch
 I have always had a deep love and concern for animals, and as a developer, I wanted to use my skills to help make a positive impact in their lives. When I looked into the state of animal shelters in my area, I saw that many of them were struggling to provide basic care and resources for the animals they were trying to help. I knew that crowdfunding could be a powerful tool for raising funds and awareness, and so I decided to focus my project on creating a platform that would help animal shelters connect with donors and raise the resources they need to provide better care for animals in need.
